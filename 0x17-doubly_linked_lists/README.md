# Doubly linked list
## What is Linked List in C?
A Linked List is a linear data structure. Every linked list has two parts, the data section and the address section that holds the address of the next element in the list, which is called a node.

The size of the linked list is not fixed, and data items can be added at any locations in the list. The disadvantage is that to get to a node, we must traverse to all the way from the first node to the node that we require. The Linked List is like an array but unlike an array, it is not stored sequentially in the memory.

## Doubly Linked List
It is called the doubly linked list because there are two pointers, one point to the next node and other points to the previous node. The operations performed in doubly linked are similar to that of a singly linked list. Hereâ€™s the code for basic operations

struct Node;
typedef struct Node * PtrToNode;
typedef PtrToNode List;

{
    Position TmpCell;
    TmpCell = (struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
    if(TmpCell == NULL)
        printf("Memory out of spacen");
    else
    {
        TmpCell->e = x;
        TmpCell->previous = p;
        TmpCell->next = p->next;
        p->next = TmpCell;
    }
}

        p1 -> next = p -> next;
        if(p2 != NULL)                  // if the node is not the last node
            p2 -> previous = p -> previous;
