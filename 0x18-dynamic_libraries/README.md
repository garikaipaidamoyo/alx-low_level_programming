# How to Create a Dynamic Library
-To create a dynamic library in Linux, simply type the following command: gcc *.c -c -fPIC and hit return. This command essentially generates one object file .o for each source file .c . The -fPIC flag ensures that the code is position-independent. This means it wouldn’t matter where the computer loads the code into memory. Some operating systems and processors need to build libraries from position-independent code so that they can decide at runtime where they want to load it into memory. The -c options just ensures that each .o file isn’t linked yet.

Next, type in the following command: gcc *.o -shared -o liball.so (substitute your desired library name with all) and hit return. The wildcard * tells the compiler to compile all the .o files into a dynamic library which is specified by the -shared flag. The naming convention for dynamic libraries is such that each shared library name must start with lib and end with .so . Other than that though, let your imagination run free when considering names for your dynamic libraries.

Finally, we’ll need to export the path for libraries so that programs know where to look for them by executing the following command: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
