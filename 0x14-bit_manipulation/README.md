#Bit manipulation
-Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte.

##Bitwise operator and description
- *&* - binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands
- *|* - binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in eather operand
- *^* - binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both
- *~* - binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the efect of 'flipping' bits
- *<<* - binary Left Shift Operator.
    - The left operands value is moved left by number of bits specified by the r      ight operand
- *>>* - binary Right Shift Operator.
    - The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specifiedby the rightoperand
